Implementation of various data manipulation operations using Pandas:
1. Data Processing:
   - CSV file reading and basic statistical analysis
   - Null value detection and replacement with mean values
   - Column aggregation using min, max, count, mean
   - Data filtering based on multiple conditions
2. DataFrame Operations:
   - Column deletion and new DataFrame creation
   - Datatype conversion
   - Data visualization using scatter plots

The code demonstrates:
